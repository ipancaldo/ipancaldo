Hi! I'm Ignacio and I'm from Argentina.
I'm a fullstack .NET developer with knowledge in Angular.

In my former job, I was working in a middleware made in .NET 6 with Azure Functions and APIs. Also, making use of Angular and SQL Server.
In my freetime, I continue learning more about Angular and other technologies, design patterns and clean code.
